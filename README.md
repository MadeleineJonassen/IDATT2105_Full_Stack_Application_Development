## Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/madelesj/fullstack.git

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

### Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

### Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build

```

### Run Unit Tests with Vitest
```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with Cypress
```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with test:e2e before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):
```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lint with ESLint
```sh
npm run lint

```

### Database Login
To log in to the database server, use the following credentials:

- IP: 129.241.98.27
- Username: student
- Password: R8W9b7D52pw
